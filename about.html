    <p><strong>Project:</strong> Ration Alert System</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      this project is to help ration card holders easily check the availability of wheat, sugar, and oil without having to visit the ration depot multiple times.

In my local area, including my own experience, people often have to visit the depot repeatedly or call other card holders to find out whether ration has arrived. This causes confusion, wasted time, and inconvenience.

To solve this problem, I created a web-based system where the depot holder (admin) can update the ration availability status and add messages such as the expected distribution date or reasons for delay.

Users can simply open the website to see the latest information, which reduces unnecessary visits and helps everyone stay informed clearly and efficiently.
