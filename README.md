# Ration Alert System

## Overview

Ration Alert System is a cloud-based web application that helps ration card holders check the availability of wheat, sugar, and oil without visiting the ration depot unnecessarily.

In many local areas, people have to visit the depot multiple times or call other card holders to confirm whether ration has arrived. This causes confusion, wasted time, and inconvenience.

This project provides a simple and mobile-friendly solution where:

- Users can check real-time ration availability.
- Depot holders (Admin) can update ration status.
- Admin can add messages such as expected distribution date or reason for delay.
- Data is stored securely in Firebase cloud database.
